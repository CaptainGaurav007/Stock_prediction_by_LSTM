# Stock_prediction_by_LSTM

This project uses **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** — a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) — to predict stock prices based on historical data. The model is built in Python and trained using a dataset of stock prices (e.g. `AAPL.csv`).  
It also includes functionality to fetch live or historical market data using an **API key** from a data provider (such as Tiingo, Alpha Vantage, or Yahoo Finance).
